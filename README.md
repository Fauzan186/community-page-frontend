# Community Page Nested Comments App

A simple React-based project demonstrating how to implement a nested comments system with features like adding, replying to, and displaying comments in a threaded format. The project is built using **Vite** for rapid development and leverages **Material-UI (MUI)** for styling and components.

## Features
- **Add Post**: Click on + icon and enter data & save it.
- **Add Comments**: Users can add top-level comments.
- **Post with Comments**: Each post displays the total number of comments.
- **Nested Replies**: Users can reply to existing comments, creating a threaded conversation.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Lightweight and Fast**: Built with Vite for fast builds and hot module replacement.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: Frontend library for building the UI.
- **Vite**: Development server and build tool for rapid development.
- **Material-UI (MUI)**: Component library for pre-designed UI elements.
- **TypeScript**: Strongly typed language for better code quality.
